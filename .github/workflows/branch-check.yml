            The source branch \`${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}\` does not appear to be based on the target branch \`${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}\`.
            
            **Recommendation:** Consider rebasing your branch to include the latest changes from the target branch:
            
            \`\`\`bash
            git checkout ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
            git fetch origin
            git rebase origin/${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}
            git push --force-with-lease
            \`\`\`
            
            This will help ensure your changes are compatible with the latest target branch and reduce potential merge conflicts.`;
